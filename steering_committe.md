The ESEC Steering Committee is responsible for constituting and guiding each edition of ESEC, the European Software 
Engineering Conference, and for establishing and evaluating practices that are binding upon the organizers of each 
conference for the continued technical and financial success of ESEC.

ESEC is a bi-annual conference that was held the first time in 1987 in Strasbourg, France. Since 1997 ESEC has a strong 
and successful partnership with ACM SIGSOFT and their FSE conference, held jointly as ESEC/FSE conferences. A list of 
all joint meetings of ESEC and FSE can be found here.

In particular, the ESEC Steering Committee is the body responsible for the long term policy of the conference series. 
Its tasks are the following ones:

* Defining the scope, aims, and long-term evolution of the series.
* Establishing the rules governing choice of officers for each conference, choice of themes, choice of location, 
representation of participating countries, refereeing standards, scientific criteria.
* Appointing the programme chair(s) and the other officers for each conference.
* Approving the major decisions of the Programme Committee.
* Approving the major decisions of the Organizing Committee.
